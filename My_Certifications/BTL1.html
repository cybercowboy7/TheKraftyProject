        <p><font size="+2">This was a 24 hour hands-on exam. The exam was extremely challenging
            due to it being a full on incident response. Once remotely entering the infected network,
            the clock began and you had 24 hours to complete it. I can't go into detail of what exactly
            was covered in the exam but it basically was an incident that started via a successful 
            file download from a phishing campaign and escalated from there. The exam really tested
            not only my knowledge in incident response and digital forensics, but it also taught me 
            how to work and manage my time efficiently in order to find all indicators of compromise etc. 
            This exam was my favorite exam due to the nature of it being 100% hands-on versus my others
            which were purely theory based.
