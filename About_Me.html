        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>If you are landing on this page by chance, I am Alexander Kraft.
        I am 25 years old, married to my beautiful wife, and we have a beautiful daughter
        named Kinsley. We also have an adorable golden doodle named Honey that we adore.</p>

        <h2>What do I do?</h2>
        <p>Currently, I am an active duty Soldier in the United States Army.
        My MOS or "Military Occupation Specialty" is 25B which is an Information Technology Specialist.
        I am currently a Sergeant (E5) which means I am mainly a direct leader to lower ranking soldiers
        as well as a maintainer and operator of the equipment and systems my unit utilizes to complete their mission.

        <h2>Why did I create this Website?</h2>
        <p>The purpose behind this website is to not only keep a well documented history of my professional career 
        but to also share things i've learned and done on the way that could be beneficial to others in their careers as well.
        This website is also a project in which I created from scratch to showcase my knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
