        <h3>Account Executive:</h3>
        <div class="section">
            As an account executive, I was in charge of generating sales and converting leads that 
            were brought in from our different marketing avenues. Throughout my year of being an 
            account executive I managed over 300 customer accounts as well as selling over $360,000 
            in sales.

        <h3>Accounting Clerk:</h3>
        <div class="section">
            After studying accounting at my community college I was granted the opportunity of a job to give me experience in
            the field I was studying within the same company. Within this role, I was in charge of multiple business facets such as accounts payable,
            payroll, customer service, and order fulfillment. I assisted in the year end tax preparation as well maintaining and growing our relationships 
            with our third party vendors.

        <h3>Electrician's Apprentice:</h3>
        <div class="section">
            Professionally, I was ready for a change and was always interested in working as an Electrician. As an Electricians Apprentice,
            I got hands on experience with house calls for simple issues such as installing new light fixtures, outlets, etc. as well as experience in electrical roughs.
            During electrical roughs in new construction, I mainly ran and stapled wire as well as gaining experience in 3 way switches and tying in devices once the rough 
            was complete and we moved onto the finish.
