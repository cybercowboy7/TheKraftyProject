        <p><font size="+3"><strong>Thought Process behind taking the Exam</strong></em></font>
        <p><font size="+2">This exam tought me a lot of in depth concepts involving the management
            side of information security. Being able to come up with solutions to scenarios whether they
            were related to business continuity solutions, cloud based vs. on premise solutions or 
            other concepts from which types of tools and commands to utilize when analyzing an infected
            system. This exam and preparation tested my knowledge in plenty of areas of information
            security quiet thoroughly.
