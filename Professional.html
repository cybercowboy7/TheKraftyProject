        <p><font size="+2"><strong><em>Account Executive:</em></strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="+2">As an account executive, I was in charge of
            generating sales and converting leads that were brought in
            from our different marketing avenues. Throughout my year of 
            being an account executive I managed over 300 customer accounts
            as well as selling over $360,000 in sales.</font></p>
        
        <p><font size="+2"><strong><em>Accounting Clerk</em></strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="+2">After studying accounting at my community college
            I was granted the opportunity of a job to give me experience in
            the field I was studying within the same company. Within this role,
            I was in charge of multiple business facets such as accounts payable,
            payroll, customer service, and order fulfillment. I assisted in the
            year end tax preparation as well maintaining and growing our relationships 
            with our third party vendors.

        <p><font size="+2"><strong><em>Electrician's Apprentice:</em></strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="+2">Professionally, I was ready for a change and was always
            interested in working as an Electrician. As an Electricians Apprentice,
            I got hands on experience with house calls for simple issues such as installing
            new light fixtures, outlets, etc. as well as experience in electrical roughs.
            During electrical roughs in new construction, I mainly ran and staped wire as well
            as gaining experience in 3 way switches and tieing in devices once the rough was
            complete and we moved onto the finish.
