        <h2>Thought Process behind taking the Exam</h2>
        <p>I took the PTO-002 version of the exam which is the newest version. 
        The main contributing factor behind taking the exam was to test my theoretical knowledge 
        of pentesting and to gauge what areas I needed to work harder on and refresh myself on.
        The bulk of the exam contained questions that had to do with either reading
        scripts, picking which nmap commands would be best for a desired scan and a lot of questions 
        in regards to reading inputs and outputs of commands, tool outputs etc.
