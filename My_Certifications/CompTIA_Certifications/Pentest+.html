        <p><font size="+3"><strong>Thought Process behind taking the Exam</strong></em></font>
        <p><font size="+2">I took the PTO-002 version of the exam which is the newest version. 
            The main contributing factor behind taking the exam was to test my theoretical knowledge 
            of pentesting and to gauge what areas I needed to work harder on and refresh myself on.
        </font></p>
        <p><font size="+2">The bulk of the exam contained questions that had to do with either reading
             scripts, picking which nmap commands would be best for a desired scan and a lot of questions 
             in regards to reading inputs and outputs of commands, tool outputs etc. </font></p>
